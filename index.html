                    As you can see in there My name is Rohit kumar I graduated with my degree in <strong>CSE from CUSAT</strong> two months ago.
                    Coming to my past days in college I did one major and one minor project in ML , I also secured 2nd position in college coding fest.
                    Well coming to this java field i feels like <strong> is very less job oppertunities for fresher in field of ml So i thought to swith myself in java side</strong> and and thatâ€™s why I wanted to interview with your firm. 
                    This position seems like a great opportunity to advance the skill I just talked about, and continue building my career and challenging myself.
                    Now coming to field other than tech I was my college's  cricket team captain and In my free time i like to discussthe ongoing current topics on internet.
                    And i like to wonder with my friends at night in free time.
